All charts get rendered by using three basic data organizing concepts in
this package.
<p>
This package provides classes for generating and managing the
data in charts. The objects <code>Value</code>, <code>Serie</code> and 
<code>Group</code> provide methods to organize all data represented in a chart.
<p>
A <code>Value</code> represents a point on a chart, in a two
dimensional coordinate system. The coordinate nomenclature is from
standard geometry: (x, y). Most chart types can be described by a series
of two dimensional values. Other attributes that effect the rendering of
a value can also be given; for example a textual label or the value's
shape.
<p>
Multiple values form a <code>Serie</code>. A Serie represents a
number of value objects arranged one after the other in succession; for
example a line in a chart, or stacked bars in a bar chart. Several
series form a <code>Group</code>.

All charts symbols (called glyphs) are defined in this package, examples
include legends and rotated text.
<p>This package provides implementations for rendering glyphs in
charts.</p>
<p>There are three interfaces in this package, at the time of this
writing. These interfaces provide the abstraction needed for rendering
glyphs.</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>IGlyph</code> provides the method contract for the
    glyphs in a two dimensional coordinate system.
    <p>The coordinate nomenclature is from standard geometry: (x,
    y).</p>
    <p>Most glyph implement the IGlyph interface by extending <code>SimpleGlyph</code>
    or <code>TextGlyph</code>, which represent a simple filled rectangle
    on the chart, or multi-lined text.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The <code>ITextGlyph</code> interface extends the IGlyph
    interface to provide the extra functionality needed to manage
    textual content.</li>
    <li>The <code>IGlyphLayoutManager</code> interface is
    implemented by glyphs that manage the layout of more than one glyph.
    The interface provides a contract of methods that need to be
    implemented to manage the layout of several glyphs.</li>
</ol>
